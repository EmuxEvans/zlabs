# Contributing to zlabs

The contributors are listed in AUTHORS (add yourself). This project uses the MPL v2 license, see LICENSE.

Please read these documents BEFORE you send a patch:

* zlabs uses the [C4.1 (Collective Code Construction Contract)](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:22) process for contributions. Please read this if you are unfamiliar with it.

* zlabs uses the [CLASS (C Language Style for Scalabilty)](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:21) guide for code style. Please read this, and also read the existing code base.

CZMQ grows by the slow and careful accretion of simple, minimal solutions to real problems faced by many people. Some people seem to not understand this. So in case you need
a place to let loose, experiment and share those experiments, *zlabs* is your haven.

* Each patch to CZMQ defines one clear and agreed problem, and one clear, minimal, plausible solution. If you come with a large, complex problem and a large, complex solution, you should put it here, in zlabs!

* CZMQ is not a sandbox where "anything goes until the next stable release". If you want to experiment, use the *zlabs*.

* If you absolutely cannot format your code to fit the documented style, see [#680](https://github.com/zeromq/czmq/issues/680) for tips on using our code formatter.
